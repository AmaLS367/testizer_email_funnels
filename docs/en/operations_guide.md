# Testizer email funnels · Operations guide

This document describes how to run and maintain the Python funnel script for the Testizer website.

## 1. Environment variables

Main variables in the `.env` file:

- `APP_ENV`

  Value: `development` or `production`.

- `APP_DRY_RUN`

  Value: `true` or `false`.

  When `true`, the script performs all read operations (queries) but does not send real requests to Brevo and does not modify data in the `funnel_entries` table. No writes to the database occur, and no Brevo API calls are performed. The script only logs what would have been done.

  For production mode, set to `false`.

- `APP_LOG_LEVEL`

  Possible values: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`.

  Recommended value for production: `INFO`.

- `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_CHARSET`

  MODX database connection parameters.

- `BREVO_API_KEY`

  API key from the Brevo dashboard.

- `BREVO_BASE_URL`

  Brevo API base URL. Default is `https://api.brevo.com/v3`.

- `BREVO_LANGUAGE_LIST_ID`

  Brevo list ID for language tests.

- `BREVO_NON_LANGUAGE_LIST_ID`

  Brevo list ID for non-language tests.

Before enabling production mode, it's important to verify that:

1. Database connection works.
2. Correct lists exist in Brevo and their IDs are recorded in `.env`.
3. `APP_DRY_RUN` is temporarily set to `true` for test runs.

## 2. Manual Task Execution

Work is performed from the project root in an activated virtual environment.

### 2.1. Activating the Environment

```powershell
cd C:\Users\user\Desktop\testizer_email_funnels
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### 2.2. Running the Main Task

```powershell
python -m app.main
```

This will:

* select candidates for language and non-language tests;
* send contacts to Brevo (or log dry-run message, depending on `APP_DRY_RUN`);
* record funnel entry in the `funnel_entries` table (or log dry-run message, depending on `APP_DRY_RUN`);
* sync certificate purchases with MODX tables and update `funnel_entries` (or log dry-run message, depending on `APP_DRY_RUN`).

### 2.3. Running Conversion Report

```powershell
python -m app.report_conversions
```

or with a date range:

```powershell
python -m app.report_conversions --from-date 2024-01-01 --to-date 2025-01-01
```

Dates are specified in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

If `--to-date` is not specified, entries up to the current moment are considered.

## 3. Transitioning from Dry Run to Production Mode

Recommended sequence:

1. Keep `APP_DRY_RUN=true`.

2. Run several times:

   ```powershell
   python -m app.main
   ```

   and check logs in `logs/app.log`, as well as logs in Brevo, to verify requests are formed correctly.

3. Verify that the logs show what would be written to the `funnel_entries` table and everything looks as expected. Note: In dry-run mode, no entries are actually written to the database.

4. Change in `.env`:

   ```text
   APP_ENV=production
   APP_DRY_RUN=false
   ```

5. Restart the task manually and verify that:

   * real contacts appear in Brevo in the correct lists;
   * the `funnel_entries` table is populated;
   * the `app.report_conversions` report returns funnel data.

## 4. Setting Up Periodic Execution on Windows (Task Scheduler)

This section describes setting up scheduling on Windows for a test environment or local setup.

1. Open "Task Scheduler".

2. Create a new task:

   * "Create Task".

   * Set a name, for example: `Testizer email funnels job`.

3. Triggers tab:

   * "Create".

   * Select schedule, for example "On a schedule" → "Hourly" or desired interval.

   * Save the trigger.

4. Actions tab:

   * "Create".

   * Action: "Start a program".

   * In the "Program or script" field, specify the path to `powershell.exe`, for example:

     ```text
     C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe
     ```

   * In the "Add arguments" field, specify:

     ```text
     -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Users\user\Desktop\testizer_email_funnels\run_job.ps1"
     ```

5. Conditions and Settings tabs:

   * Configure as needed (can leave default values).

6. Save the task.

## 5. run_job.ps1 Script

For convenience, you can extract Python execution into a separate PowerShell script `run_job.ps1` in the project root:

```powershell
$projectPath = "C:\Users\user\Desktop\testizer_email_funnels"
Set-Location $projectPath
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m app.main
```

This file should be specified in the scheduler arguments.

## 6. Monitoring Recommendations

* Check the `logs/app.log` file for errors.

* Periodically run:

  ```powershell
  python -m app.report_conversions
  ```

  to track funnel effectiveness for language and non-language tests.
