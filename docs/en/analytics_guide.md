# Testizer email funnels · Analytics guide

This document describes what metrics are available in the current version of the script and how to use them.

## 1. funnel_entries Table Structure

The `funnel_entries` table is used for basic funnel analytics.

Important fields:

- `email`

  User email address.

- `funnel_type`

  Funnel type:

  - `language` for language tests;

  - `non_language` for non-language tests.

- `user_id`, `test_id`

  Link to test and user in MODX database.

- `entered_at`

  Date and time when the user entered the funnel.

- `certificate_purchased`

  Flag:

  - `0` certificate not purchased;

  - `1` certificate purchased.

- `certificate_purchased_at`

  Date and time of certificate purchase. Populated during synchronization with MODX tables.

## 2. Conversion Report

To view funnel conversion, use the script:

```powershell
python -m app.report_conversions
```

Example output:

```text
Funnel conversion report
------------------------
language: entries=10, purchased=3, conversion=30.00%
non_language: entries=5, purchased=1, conversion=20.00%
```

Where:

* `entries` number of users who entered the funnel;
* `purchased` number of users who purchased a certificate after entering the funnel;
* `conversion` ratio `purchased / entries` as a percentage.

### 2.1. Date Filtering

You can specify a period:

```powershell
python -m app.report_conversions --from-date 2024-01-01 --to-date 2025-01-01
```

* `--from-date` inclusive;
* `--to-date` exclusive.

If only `--from-date` is specified, entries from that date to the current moment are considered.

If parameters are not specified, all entries from `funnel_entries` are taken.

## 3. Interpreting Results

Example questions that can be answered:

* How many people entered the language funnel in the last month?
* What is the conversion rate from funnel to certificate purchase for language tests?
* How does language test conversion differ from non-language tests?

For more detailed analytics, you can use SQL queries to `funnel_entries`, combining conditions by `email`, `user_id`, `test_id`, and time.

## 4. Extending Analytics with UTM Tags

Currently, the script does not modify email content, only sends contacts to Brevo. For extended analytics via UTM tags, you can use the following approach:

1. Add UTM tags to links in Brevo email templates, for example:

   * for language funnel:

     `?utm_source=testizer&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=language_funnel`

   * for non-language:

     `?utm_source=testizer&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=non_language_funnel`

2. Analyze clicks on these UTMs in analytics systems (e.g., Google Analytics or similar).

3. If needed, link external analytics with `funnel_entries` data by email and time periods.

With this approach, the database and script structure doesn't change, and extended analytics is configured through email templates and external reports.

## 5. Possible Development Directions

If more detailed analytics are needed in the future, you can:

* add a `source` field to `funnel_entries`, for example `email_language_v1`, `email_non_language_v1`;
* record funnel or campaign version there;
* build reports by combination of `funnel_type` + `source`.

The current architecture is already ready for such extensions, as:

* funnel entry is recorded centrally in `funnel_entries`;
* certificate purchase is linked to the same entries;
* the `app.report_conversions` report can be extended without changing the main business code.
